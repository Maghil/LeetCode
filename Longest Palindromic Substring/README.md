mine.py solves the problem in a brute force approach 
1.iterating over the string
2.and extracting substring till end of the main string
3.then checking if its palindrome if the start and end characters of aphabets match

suggested alternative solution
1. use dict to iterate the list once to get the character count and only iterate through strings that matches
2. seemed sus have to check solution page
